        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp What is a coronavirus?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
        </div>
      </div>
	   <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
        </div>
      </div>
	   <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is, therefore, possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.
        </div>

	   <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.
        </div>
      </div>
	   <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can I catch COVID-19 from the faeces of someone with the disease?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         The risk of catching COVID-19 from the faeces of an infected person appears low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in faeces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.
        </div>
      </div>
	   <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

          1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

          2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

          3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

          4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread the virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

          5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent the spread of viruses and other infections.

          6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid travelling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         The "incubation period" means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
        </div>

	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with a simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.
        </div>
      </div>
	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is there anything I should not do?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         These measures are not effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful: Smoking, Wearing multiple masks, Taking antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your healthcare provider.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. However, several ongoing clinical trials include both western and traditional medicines.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         As of 18 February 2021, at least seven different vaccines across three platforms have been rolled out in countries. Vulnerable populations in all countries are the highest priority for vaccination.

         At the same time, more than 200 additional vaccine candidates are in development, of which more than 60 are in clinical development. COVAX is part of the ACT Accelerator, which WHO launched with partners in 2020. COVAX, the vaccines pillar of ACT Accelerator, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO, aims to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

         Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be approved by national regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed.

	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp How do I pre-register myself online for an appointment for vaccination?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Online registration and appointment can be done through Co-WIN portal. From one mobile phone number, one can register 4 people, however, each person will need their photo identification document. If an Aadhaar Card is used as an identification document, consent will be obtained and recorded.

         Through the portal, you can find out the list of available CVCs and dates and time of available vaccination slots, to book an appointment as per your choice. You will need an OTP verification before registration and a confirmation slip/token will be generated after registration. You will also get a confirmatory SMS later.

         For all Private Hospitals, prior registration and appointment will be the only method of registration.

         For Government hospitals, a proportion of slots will be available for online registration and appointment, the rest will be kept for on-site registration and vaccination. Appointments for any date for a Vaccination Center will be closed at noon on the day prior to the date.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during the second dose?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         As the vaccines available are not interchangeable, it is important to receive the second dose of the same vaccine as the first one. The Co-WIN portal is also going to help to ensure that everyone receives the same vaccine.
        </div>
      </div>
	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp What precautions do I need to take after receiving the vaccine?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         Both the vaccines are safe but in case of any discomfort or complaint, ask the beneficiary to visit the nearest health facility and/or call the health worker whose phone number is given in the Co-WIN SMS received after vaccination.

	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Does vaccination protect me against newer strains / mutated viruses of SARS-CoV 2?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         The body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies to virus parts including spike protein. Therefore, all vaccines are expected to provide a reasonable amount of protection against the mutated virus also. Based on the available data the mutations as reported are unlikely to make the vaccine ineffective.
        </div>
      </div>
	  <div class="bar">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> &nbsp Which vaccine is better between Covisheild and Covaxin?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
         There is no head-to-head comparison done between the two vaccines being used in India so one cannot choose one over the other. Both would work fine in preventing the infection as well as prevent a person from going into a severe state of the disease. As a long-term effect, it would be preventing death for elderly people or those who have comorbidities.
